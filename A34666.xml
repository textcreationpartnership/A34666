         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>one,</hi> firſt to a remote part of the world, there to plant <hi>Churches;</hi> and thence (after that happy work done) to heaven: The <hi>other,</hi> to ſome more publique ſervice neerer hand: in which I humbly crave the beſt help of your prayers, as you are conſtantly remembred in mine; and that with more ſtrength of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whilſt I oft call to mind thoſe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable daies, in which I enjoyed the happineſs of joynt Miniſtry with ſo able and faithfull a Guide; and both of us ſo much ſatisfaction and encouragement from a people ſo united in the love both of the truth, and of one another.

               <pb facs="tcp:61324:3"/>but I think I read over what we then found in <hi>Boſton.</hi> They were then very happy daies with you, when <hi>your faith did grow excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,</hi> and <hi>your love</hi> to Chriſts Ordinances, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſervants, and to one another <hi>abounded.</hi> Although your Town be ſituate in a low Countrey, yet God then raiſed your eſteem very high, and your eminency in Piety over-topped the heighth of your ſteeple; your name <hi>was as an oyntment poured out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1.3.</note> and your <hi>renown went forth for that beauty and comelineſſe which God had put upon you.</hi>

Such a frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and way, I can remember, was ſometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; and as oft as I remember it, I deſire not to forget to praiſe God for it. <hi>What was then your bleſſedneſſe?</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſai. 60.15.</note> 
               <hi>and a joy of many generations.</hi> This you and I have the more cauſe to deſire and endeavour, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Miſerum eſt fuiſse,</hi> it is a great miſery to have it ſaid of us, that we have been happy. <hi>Fuimus Troec,
<pb facs="tcp:61324:3"/>fuit Ilium,</hi> was but a ſad word, and it is a ſadder thing for the Sun of righteouſneſs which had ſometime ſhone gloriouſly upon any particular Church or people, at laſt to ſet in a cloud; if ſuch a light come to be darkned, how <hi>great is that darkneſſe?</hi> after the light is put out, the room proveth darker then if it had never been ſet up; and the remembrance of thoſe former pleaſant things once enjoyed, but afterwards loſt,
<note place="margin">Lam. 1.7.</note> added to, and aggravated the Churches lamentation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet ſuch a lamentable condition hath been and may be the lot of ſuch places &amp; people which God ſometimes hath highly honoured, when they have grown fat and wanton toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Bethel</hi> hath proved <hi>Bethaven;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10.5. 2 Kings 2. Judg. 8.8.

<note place="margin">Prov. 24.31.</note> and <hi>loe they were all grown over with thorns, &amp; nettles had covered the face therof, &amp; the ſtone-wall therof was broken down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And which is more ſad, in ſome of them never, in others very hardly built up again: <hi>God</hi> proving ſevere, when <hi>we</hi> grow wanton, and ſo as he <hi>removeth the Candleſtick</hi> when we play or fight by the light of the candle ſet up in it;
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.5.</note> ſo he is very hardly induced to light it againe in that place where it hath once been wantonly or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly put out: there are more hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a particular perſon fallen, by vertue of
<pb facs="tcp:61324:4"/>an everlaſting covenant made with him (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he may goe halting to his grave, and never here again riſe up to his former comforts and enlargements) but a particular Church or people (unleſs it be that of the Jewes, who in the great Jubile after their rejection ſhal again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former poſſeſſions) cannot claim the like priviledge of ſuch a Covenant.
<note place="margin">Jer. 3.1, 12, 13, 14, 8, 4.</note> The <hi>Arke</hi> never returned to the ſame place from whence it was in a way of judgement removed; and the <hi>glory of the Lord,</hi> when after its gradual removes, was at laſt quite gone from the <hi>firſt Temple,</hi> was not fully reſtored in the <hi>ſecond</hi> till <hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt comming; nor wil it be in this their rejection, til his ſecond.

            <p>When <hi>Eve</hi> brought forth <hi>Cain,</hi> ſhe hoped ſhe had got the Promiſed ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.1. with 3.15.</p>
            <p>But when ſhe ſaw by his ſpirit and carriage, that ſhe was deceived in him, ſhe called her next ſonne <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4.2. which ſignifieth vanity.</p>
            <p>And ſo ſhe muſt ſee all things to be, before ſhe bring forth <hi>Seth,</hi> the Father of the promiſed ſeed: Now <hi>Abel,</hi> or vanity, expreſſeth the ſtate of all the creatures by the fall. And <hi>Solomon</hi> taketh up <hi>Eves</hi> word, and amplifieth it, <hi>vanity, yea, vanity of vanities.</hi> So this whole book is a Commentary upon the ſtate of corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20.

               <p>THe chiefe good of the ſonnes of men, which the morall Philoſophers amongſt the Heathen ſought after, but found not, <hi>Solomon</hi> in this book truly and fully openeth to us. The Philoſophers being vain and wicked themſelves, how could they finde or teach the true chiefe good? but this wiſe and good King, upon his own experience, both found it himſelfe, and taught us to finde it after him.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his diſcourſe ſtandeth upon theſe two points: 1. That the chiefe good of the ſonnes of men is not to be found in all the creatures under the Sun, nor in mens labours and waies about them. For they are all vanity and vexation of Spirit. 2. That it is to be found in the feare of God and keeping his Commandements, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. v. 13.</p>

               <p>It is a participle of a verb out of uſe in the Active voyce, yet in the Paſſive uſed to ſignifie, to be gathered, or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; whence <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p n="1">1. Our Saviours teſtimony, that all the Prophets are in heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Salomon</hi> was a Prophet, ſeeing the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was penned by no other but Prophets and Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.</p>

               <p>The favour of God, the blood of Chriſt, the fellowſhip of Gods ſpirit, the word of promiſe, the Covenant of grace and peace. But natural things which are themſelves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, they leave our minds reſtleſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do ſatisfie the mind and heart of a Chriſtian; his eye would ever ſee the favour of God, and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhining upon him; his ear would ever hear the things belonging to his peace.</p>
               <p>The eye or ear not to be ſatisfied, with ſuch or ſuch things, implyeth either</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a man careth not to ſee or hear any more of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61324:13"/>them, as having enough of them, and yet would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides them, as being not contented with them; ſo it is meant here, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1, 3.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, in heavenly things a man having true and full contentment in them, yet deſireth to partake more and more of them, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. For ſuch things doe yield true ſatisfaction to the eye, and eare, and taſte, when as a man is deſirous alwaies to ſee and heare, and taſte the ſame. And ſo is it in heavenly things: the more we taſte of them, the more we deſire them, and yet are fully ſatisfied and contented with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that a man not having enough of that he ſeeth and heareth, would have more of it, and yet cannot attain it, and thereupon is vexed: as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> not fully comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the courſe of <hi>Euripus,</hi> is ſaid to have caſt himſelfe into it; and ſo is it alſo meant here in ſundry difficulties of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Are new; full of freſh and ſweet variety of newneſſe: To a new creature, behold all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5, 17, Not onely within him, new mind new judgement, new conſcience, new heart, new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, (new joyes, feares, griefes, cares, deſires, &amp;c.) new ſpeeches, new life; But alſo without him, new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yea thoſe things he buſieth himſelfe about, they yeild him continually new matter to be refreſhed withall: The favour of God, the blood of Chriſt, the fellowſhip of the Spirit, the more they are heard or ſeen, the more novelty they are to us; the Word the oftner read, ſtill yieldeth us more knowledge, new comfort, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of the eſtate of glory, but of grace, when he ſaith, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor eare heard ſuch things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. The natural man never perceived them (and therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth, the Princes of this world could not deviſe ſuch things to keep people in awe) they are new when they are firſt perceived of the godly; and they feele a new, freſh, ſweet ſavour in them, as oft as the ſeeing or hearing of them is renewed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61324:13"/>placed happineſſe in contemplation (meaning of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) but ſheweth they were deceived.

                  <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> reaſon to the contrary, that water coveteth to run to the loweſt place: And if the water ſhould have this viciſſitude, of courſe from the Fountaines to the Sea, from the Sea to the Fountains; then the ſame place ſhould be higher and lower then it ſelfe; will not hold. For ſome parts of the Sea are lower then the Fountaines, and into them the Fountaines ſend forth their ſtreams to run; other parts of the Sea are as high, or higher then the Fountaines, eſpecially in great ſtorms, when the waves ſeem to aſcend up to heaven, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.26. And they by ſecret channels another way ſend forth Springs of water to feed the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato's Barathrum</hi> in the hollow Caverns of the earth, which he maketh to be the originall of Fountaines, is hence alſo refuted, unleſſe he derive the ſupplying of that Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum from the Sea.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the earth, through which the Sea waters paſſe to the Fountaines, doth percolate and ſtrain the Salt out of them; elſe, as the ſea waters are ſalt, ſo would alſo the Fountaine waters be.</p>
               <p>That ſome fountaines of water are ſalt as the ſea, ariſeth from the openneſs of the pores of the earth between the ſea and them; which is alſo the cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A pattern of thankfull returning what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to the Fountain that ſupplieth us; as we receive all bleſſings from God, ſo let us return all to him.</p>

               <p>To anſwer theſe, and ſuch like doubts, many interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and limitations of theſe words have been given, which were not worth rehearſing, as that of <hi>Cajetan</hi> concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> to reaſon from the Eternity of time to argue the circular motion of naturall bodies; and that alledged of <hi>Origen,</hi> touching <hi>Plato's</hi> great yeare, of 49000 yeares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would have all the Starres to come to the ſame Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo all things to return again in the ſame courſe. But to touch onely thoſe which come neerer to the truth; Some have thought (amongſt whom <hi>Hierome</hi>) that all things now done, were firſt in Gods Predeſtination; but though that be a truth, yet not pertinent here: For Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is above the Sunne; and things done here accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, are new ſtill under the Sunne, as having never been done under the Sunne before. Beſides, Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination was not in old time before us, but before all time.</p>
               <p>Others underſtand the words, as denying new Arts; but what will they ſay of the Art of Printing?</p>
               <p>Others (as <hi>Pineda</hi>) underſtand it of no new happineſſe, nor any new way to attain it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak of the want of new objects to eye and eare, whence it commeth to paſſe that they are not ſatisfied, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Others (and that rightly) conceive him to ſpeak of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, and their naturall actions. <hi>Avicen. ſup. Q.</hi> 91. <hi>A,</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>For of theſe <hi>Solomon</hi> here diſcourſeth, to prove that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe cannot be found in the knowledge of theſe, becauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61324:15"/>they are wanting in newneſſe and variety. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Natura nihil molitur novi.</hi> Though upon this particular occaſion he ſeemeth to reach further, in denying newneſſe to the common affaires of men in the world.</p>
               <p>For <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. he denieth remembrance of former things, which is not wont to be taken up about naturall bodies, or the actions of them, but eſpecially about men and their affaires.</p>
               <p>And indeed in Civil matters there be the like manners of men now as of old; the like cauſes and ſucceſſes of warre and peace &amp;c. whence the knowledge of Hiſtory of former times is ſo much behovefull: ſo in Church matters, like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Like oppoſition to the truth by falſe teachers, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.8. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. Like ſecurity, forerunning generall judgements, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.26, to 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ</hi> 1. For anſwer therefore to the former doubts, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaketh not of Gods miraculous and extraordinary actions, whether of judgement or grace: ſuch as the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, the ſtanding of the Sunne, the Birth and death of Chriſt, the writing of the Scriptures, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6.</p>

               <p>But ſtudying the nature of all things, which by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conference men might learn one of another, would enlarge our hearts to God, and our skil to uſefulneſſe to our ſelves and others.</p>

               <p>For no man may expect to finde more good by his labour after theſe things then <hi>Solomon</hi> did: yet this was the iſſue of all his labour ſo beſtowed.</p>

               <p n="3">3. God never gave labour about earthly things that bleſſing as to yeild felicity. It was <hi>Solomons</hi> fault to look to reape that fruit from his labour, which God never gave it. He ſhould rather have hated the vanity of his own minde which abuſed his labour to a wrong end.

                  <hi>SOlomon</hi> having oberved a vanity that befalleth the eſtates of men, Firſt, by the overuling providence of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61324:40"/>God, limiting all their changes, verſe 1. to 14. Secondly, By the hand and government of Courts of Juſtice over other men, verfe 16.17. Leaſt this ſhould reflect any diſhonour upon the providence of God, whereby he governeth all things in the world wiſely, righteouſly, holily: He taketh up and giveth himſelfe and others a two-fold ſatisfaction in this point, from a two-fold meditation. 1. From the order of which God will take to redreſſe all the iniquities of Courts of Juſtice, both in this and in another world, verſe 17. 2. From the end which God aymeth at in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Courts of Juſtice to ſuch iniquity, which is double, Firſt, God doth it to try them; Secondly, He doth it to let them ſee, They are as beaſts one to another, verſe 18. And to convince them the more of this latter, that men be but beaſts, he argueth it not only from their uſage of one another as beaſts, but from ſundry events common to them with beaſts; that which befalleth the ſons of men, befalleth the beaſts, to both alike. Which he argueth, Firſt, for their bodies in three particulars: 1. In the likeneſſe of their deaths, as one dyeth, ſo dyeth the other. 2. In the likeneſſe of their breath, they have all one breath, verſe 19. 3. In their burial and reſolution of their bodies; all turne to the duſt as they came from it. Secondly, For the ſoul or ſpirit of man which goeth upward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt that goeth downward, this difference is not known or acknowledged, diſcerned, or conſidered by men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to wit, not by natural men at all, verſe 21. From whence he taketh this Corollary, That ſeeing a man can take ſo little comfort or contentment in the eſtate or courſe of other men, therefore ſo to live as a man may rejoyce in his own workes, verſe 22. which he proveth Firſt, from the propriety he hath in that courſe, it is his portion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, From the impoſſibility to know what ſhall be after him, verſe 22. or from his uncertainty of future events.

His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was diſeaſed with the ſcurvey which maketh the body weake, and liſtleſſe; and when nature is grown weak, the retentive faculty is weakned that he hath no hold of his excrements.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon of envy at good:</hi> Firſt, pride of heart, and exceſſive ſelf-love; For envy is the ſadneſſe of the heart for the good that we ſee in another; in regard ſo much glory (or praiſe) ſeemeth to be taken from us, as is given to him; <hi>Eliab</hi> taxed that in <hi>David,</hi> which was his own ſin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. Hence hatred of brother, as wiſhing him deprived of the good he hath. Secondly, Prophane and rebellious infidelity; For either we doe not believe that our brother hath theſe gifts given him of God, (for if we did, it would mortifie envy. <hi>John</hi> 3.26, 27.) and this is prophane infidelity: Or elſe, if we believe they were forgiven him of God, it is rebellious infidelity to grudge againſt Gods goodneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. Thirdly, want of union with Chriſt, and communion with our brethren; For if we were united to Chriſt by faith, and one to another by brotherly love, the glory of Chriſt would be a comfort to us, by whomſoever advanced, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.16, to 19, And if we were united in brotherly love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the honour of one member would be the joy of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. One finger envieth not another that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Gold ring, as taking it for an ornament of the whole hand, yea of the whole body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon why it is afflictive;</hi> Firſt, To the envious perſon, it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61324:44"/>rotteth and waſteth the vigour of body and ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30. Secondly, to the perſon envied, 1. It is a dangerous threatning loſſe of life, as in <hi>Abel, Joſeph, David, Daniel,</hi> Chriſt; It is murther, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.4. 2 It is uncomfortable and grievous to ſee a mans ſelf ſo il-beloved, that his good ſhould be another mans harm.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Means againſt this ſin:</hi> Firſt, faith to diſcern whence gifts ſpring, <hi>John</hi> 3.27. Secondly, Love to look at them as given to our uſe. What if all the Town were good Phiſitians, and I only had no skil that way? The more ready help it would be to me. What though <hi>Deborah</hi> did not kill <hi>Siſera,</hi> but <hi>Jael?</hi> yet <hi>Deborah</hi> rejoyceth in it heartily, <hi>Judges</hi> 25.24.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. An idle perſon by his forbearance of labour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe both a fool and a beggar; or a man that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth himſelfe from labour, doth both befool and undoe himſelfe. Folding of the hands together, is an act of an idle or ſlothful perſon, Firſt, withholding himſelfe from labour, Secondly, Compoſing himſelfe to reſt, or ſleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30, 33, and 6, 10. It is all one, whether he fold his fingers together, or fold his armes together, put his hands into his pocket or boſome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19, 24.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſons</hi> of befooling himſelfe, Firſt, it is folly to miſtake Names and Natures of things, eſpecially to delude our ſelves with falſe names. To account and call that to be quietneſſe which is idleneſſe, ſloathfulneſſe, ſluggiſhneſſe, to account diligent labour, Travel, vexation of ſpirit.

Thirdly, It is folly to thinke an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gotten with eaſe and idleneſſe, is better then both the handfuls with diligent labour; whereas a little gotten with labour is more precious and comfortable, <hi>Eccleſ,</hi> 5.12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.27. Fourthly, It is folly, yea a fooliſh tempting of God, to ſeparate the end from the meanes; to expect maintenance without labour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. Fifthly, It is a like folly to ſeparate the meanes from the end, God having given hands to labour, minde and wit to employ in ſome honeſt calling, for private and publike good ends, which to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is a ſloathful folly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.26. 6.

And that in all the affairs which are incident to humane life; which are all of them either, firſt, Voluntary: of which kind he putteth in (as in the reſt) one example for many; as labour; Two have a better reward for their labour, <hi>v.</hi> 9.

Thirdly, natural: if two lie together, then they have heat: amplified by deniall of warmth to one alone, <hi>v.</hi> 11.

               <p>Some conceive, this place ſpoken in praiſe of marriage, and preferment of it above ſingle life; but though that have the place here, marriage being one kind of ſociety, yet is not marriage onely here meant. Yea, the Proverb of a threefold cord doth not ſo fitly agree to that. Polygamy is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61324:48"/>before Digamy; I mean before the marriage of two, one man with one woman.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in voluntary affaires; God would have two workmen chiefe about the Ark, 1 <hi>Bezaliel.</hi> 2 <hi>Aholiab. Exod.</hi> 31.2, 6. The Egyptians in <hi>Pierius</hi> Hieroglyphicks expreſſed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs of a ſolitary man by one milſtone which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone grindeth no meale, but with his fellow is moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to prepare meale, and ſo bread for man. In the body all inſtruments of action are made by paires, as hands, feet, eyes, eares, legs, things, &amp;c. though but one head; it is becauſe a man hath liberty to conſult with many heads in any buſineſſe of importance. Yea, if the buſineſs be urgent, and require haſt, yet he hath another, his wife in his own family. In ſpiritual things, Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples two by two, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſent out together, by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. And when they fell out, <hi>Paul</hi> took <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> took <hi>Mark, Acts</hi> 15.39, 40. Hence a Paſtor and a Teacher appointed to aſſiſt one another for one Congregation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. In all duties two or three have a ſpecial aſſiſtance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Caſual events; Though a man may travel often, and finde no harm, meet with no fall; or having fallen, may help himſelfe. yer ſometimes a dangerous fall happeneth, in which ſociety helpeth and ſaveth, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30. which is moſt apparent in ſpiritual fals, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1, to 13. 2 Chron. 19.2. In theſe fals which are bodily, men ſooner feel their falls, and the danger of them; but in ſpirituall falls ſinne is of a venemous nature, and like ſome poyſons blindeth the eyes, and ſtupifieth the feeling; ſo that here a faithful Chriſtian helper is a ſpecial mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In natural diſpoſitions and works; if one lie alone, in old and cold age, or in cold weather, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.1, 2. Brands of fire laid together keep heat; one alone, though never ſo wel kindled, goeth out. In ſpiritual matters much more. Compare 2 Cor. 1.12, 13. with Acts 18.5. See alſo 2 Chron. 24.2, 17, 18. &amp; 26.5, 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In violent aſſaults, one much helpeth his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9, to 12. In ſpiritual aſſaults it is the like caſe: <hi>Eve</hi> alone yeilded to the tempter, who if ſhe had kept with her husband, and conſulted with him, might have reſiſted the temptation, and kept her innocency.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When a man hath vowed a vow to God, he is to pay it, and that without delay, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21, 22, 23. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 76.11. &amp; 56.12. Thy vows are upon me, as an engagement or debt, which a faithful man would be careful to diſcharge to men, much more to God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.14. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.15.

The Reaſons againſt delay of payment of vows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a vow is. A lawfull vow; it is a promiſe made to God, wherein a man bindeth his ſoule to perform ſome acceptable work to God. Firſt, <hi>A promiſe made to God</hi>] wherein it differeth from a Prayer. In a Prayer we require ſomething which God hath promiſed to us. In a vow we promiſe ſomething to God; Hence in the Text, the vow is ſaid to be vowed to God, <hi>v.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 2. Secondly, A man bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his ſoule to God in them, <hi>Num.</hi> 30.4. Thirdly, To perform ſome acceptable thing to God; unlawfull things we may not vow, as the Jewes did, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.12, 13. nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, nor unſuitable to our calling. But two ſorts of things are acceptable matter of vows: Firſt, Religious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God in his Commandements, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.106. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21. Secondly, Helps to obedience, and removall of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments. Payment of tithes was an help to worſhip, and to the maintenance of it in thoſe daies when God accepted ſuch a maintenance for his Prieſts, <hi>Neh</hi> 9.38. with 10.29, 32. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.22. So contributions, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.37. So the vow of a Nazarite, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. was a removall of an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. a prevention of diſhonour to <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſeaſonable time of vowing, is, 1. When we ſtand in need of ſome ſpecial ſavour from God; then as we deſire God might draw more nigh to us in ſpecial mercy, ſo it is meet we ſhould draw more nigh to God in ſpeciall duty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21, 22. <hi>Num.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3. Secondly, When we have received ſome ſpeciall mercy, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.8, 9. &amp; 76.11. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.16. Thirdly, When we finde our hearts ready to betray us to this or that evil by occaſion, we may vow againſt ſuch occaſions, and vow alſo the contrary duties, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. 2 Cor. 11.10. which argueth vows are not unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in the daies of the Goſpel. Fourthly, when we are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61324:53"/>to enter into ſome new Relation whereof God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: and the Duties of the Relation depend upon our Vows or Covenants with God, and with one another.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61324:61"/>the means of his maintenance (like a Dropſy thirſt) is never filled. And thus fareth it with the Learned Scholler, the rich Churle, the Induſtrious and prudent poor man: Theſe Vanities fall alike to them all, how much leſs is the immortal ſoul ſilled?</p>

The houſe of feaſting is commonly preferred amongſt men, as more deſirable to be gone unto, above the houſe of mourning; but here the day of mourning, even the greateſt mourning, (mourning for the dead) is preferred before the houſe of feaſting. Better it is (ſaith he) to go to the houſe

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. It is better (or a more deſireable good thing) to go to an houſe of mourning for the dead, then to an houſe of feaſting for the ſolace of the living. Of feaſts there be three ſorts. 1. Civil feaſts where a fourfold ſolace: Firſt, Eating the fat and drinking the ſweet; Secondly, Loving and neighbourly company: Thirdly, Pleaſant diſcourſe and ſometimes Muſick: Fourthly, Increaſe of mutual neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly love. 2. Prophane or riotous, where the former comforts are abuſed, and perverted. Firſt, by Exceſſe in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking to gluttony and drunkenneſſe: Secondly, The Company, ſwaggering and debaucht Ruffians, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and roaring Boyes: Thirdly, Inſtead of pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes Ribaldry, wanton ſongs and dances, abuſing of the name of God or man. Fourthly, fallings out and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: or elſe linking in conſpiracy to doe ſome miſchiefe. 3. Holy feaſts; where, Firſt, Gods inſtitution or ſpecial mercies invite to thankfulneſſe: and meat and drink as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.12. Secondly, Chriſtian company: Thirdly, Holy conference, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.1, to 8. and ſo to the end: Fourthly, Increaſe of childlike love to God, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love one to another. Of this laſt ſort of feaſts, the compariſon is not put: for Gods ordinances are more edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then his providences. Nor it it to civil, eſpecially to godly men put of the ſecond ſort of feaſts, Riotous. For to honeſt and good men. It is an houſe of mourning to be in ſuch an houſe of feaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. But here he ſpeaketh of ſuch an houſe of feaſting as is contrary to the houſe of mourning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From the nature of the occaſion of that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it being the death of ſome or other deſirable perſon in the family, that death is the end of all men. If the perſon dead were not deſirable, there is little or no mourning for him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.19, 20. But if there be mourning, all uſeful men will ſee their own end in his, which is very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to our ſpirits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32, 29. <hi>Lamen.</hi> 1.9. In feaſting men

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not the houſe of feaſting offer to our hearts many ſerious and ſavoury meditations?

Phyſitians count it a ſigne of deadly danger, when a ſickneſſe or diſtemper ſo altereth the countenance, that you cannot know the ſame man, ſo <hi>Job</hi> 14.20. Anger will doe as much, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.19. Phyſitians will alſo ſay, It is a ſigne of the healing and abatement of an Ague, when in an hot fit the tongue is cleane; but if the tongue be foule, it is a ſigne the diſeaſe is ſtill ſtrong. When a man in his anger giveth never a foul word, it is a ſigne of an healthful ſpirit: but the ſoul is diſtemped, if the ſpeech in anger be foul. If a glaſſe bottle be full of cleane water, though it be ſtirred, there ariſeth no mud: but if mud ariſe when it is ſtirred, the water was foul in the bottome; ſo is the ſpirit of a man foul within; that being ſtirred ſheweth diſtemper. Let therefore all haſtineſſe to anger againſt all ſorts of perſons, at all times be eſchewed. For <hi>Solomon</hi> here limiteth it to none: be it againſt husband, or wife, child, or ſervant, friends, or enemies. 2. Yet this hindreth not juſt anger, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. 2. But it much more condenmeth all malice, hatred, ſtudy of revenge; for all theſe are from anger reſting in the boſome.</p>

                  <hi>SOlomon</hi> in this Chapter hath hitherto ſhewed the vanity of ſundry things of good account in the world, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of other things of leſſe eſteem: and hath therefore preferred, Firſt, A good name before a good oyntment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The day of death before the birth day. Thirdly, To goe to the houſe of mourning, before going to the houſe of feaſting. Fourthly, To heare the rebuke of the wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſong of fooles. In this verſe he goeth on with the like argument, not preferring elder times before the preſent, though generally men are apt ſo to doe. Parts two, 1. A prohibition of taking it for granted that elder times are better then theſe, and of the inquiry after the reaſon of it. Say not thou, what is it that the former times were better then theſe? 2. A reaſon of the prohibition taken from the want of wiſdome in ſuch an apprehenſion, and enquiry; for thou doeſt not enquire wiſely, or out of wiſedome concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The ordinary conceit that men have of the excellency of former times above theſe, and their ordinary inquiry into the reaſon thereof, is not out of wiſdome. Heathen Authors may be quoted, not for divine or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical points, but natural or moral. Both Heathen and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are wont to have ſuch a conceit, that former times were better. <hi>Horace</hi> his old man, is <hi>laudator temporis acti ſe puero.</hi> Againe ſaith he, <hi>Damnoſa quid non imminuit diesë Aetas parentum pejor Avis tulit nos nequiores, mox daturos progeniem vitioſiorem. Boetius de conſolatione Philoſophiae. Fortunae, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium prior Aetas, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ordinarily men extol the cheapneſs of former times, their great hoſpitality, their kind neighbourhood, their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt dealing; their skilful workmanſhip, none ſuch now adayes; their liberal almes deeds, their devout piety, their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61324:71"/>deep wiſdome, their valiant acts; The reaſons which men are wont to give of it, are not wiſe: as, Firſt, <hi>Laſſa effaeta natura,</hi> The decay of the ſtrength and goodneſſe of nature, in the world and all the creatures. But this is no good reaſon; for nature decayed by the flood; yet the times have been better. Secondly, The goodneſſe of the old religion, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44, 17, 18. The Heathen thought the Empire flouriſhed more under the worſhip of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and other falſe gods, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian Religion. The devouter Papiſts thinke the ſame, that it was a better world under their Religion, then ours; but if the old Religion have been worſe, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times may be worſe for their ſins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.21, 22, 23. Thirdly, The change of times which ſome thinke are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for the worſe. So <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> But neither times nor ſtarres were made to rule us.</p>
               <p>Reaſons of the want of wiſdome of ſuch a conceit and ſuch enquiry. Firſt, From the like eſtate of former times as of theſe; no new thing under the Sun, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the cauſe of the worſe appearance of preſent times from fonde miſtakings. As, Firſt, In youth want of Judgement to diſcerne and judge of good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Thy Judgement then was green and raw; young mens ſpirits are green and cheerful, and ſo looking through a green glaſſe (as it were) thou ſaweſt all things green and pleaſant. Old men are ſplenetick and ſad, and ſee all things through darke and ſad fumes, and ſo accordingly thinke hardly of them. Beſides by better experience, old men now can diſcerne much evil, which before they could not obſerve. Secondly, Through ignorance of hiſtory, which ſpeaketh of as bad times as ours Or elſe through the choyce that Hiſtorians make to tell of notable matters, and neglect common occurrences: beſides its pleaſant to read in ſtories of great warres, and exploits; but to feele them would ſeem Tragical. Thirdly, Through following ſenſe in this conceit, evils preſent ſeem worſt, as in governments ſo in the whole life of man. Fourthly, Through diſcontentment with a mans own perſonal condition, and envy at others, and vaine glory in our ſelves; hence <hi>Neſtor, Oh mihi praeteritos referat ſi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vitio malignitatis humanae vetera ſemper in laude, praeſentia faſtidio eſſe. Tacitus.</hi> Fifthly, Through curioſity, whileſt men look more at others then themſelves, whereas if every man laboured to amend himſelfe, the times would ſoon amend.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſo</hi> 23. From the true eſtate of this matter, which may be diſcerned and obſerved in theſe particulars. Firſt, When Princes and people are good in Gods ſight, the times are better, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.1, to 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2. when they are wicked, then worſe, <hi>Ibid. Jer.</hi> 22.15, to 18. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26, throughout, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Davids</hi> time better then <hi>Sauls,</hi> But <hi>Rehoboams</hi> afterwards worſe. Secondly, When Churches are well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and encouraged therein, the times are better, elſe worſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16, to 23, with verſe 8, 9. Thirdly, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the times are better for ſomething, and worſe for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both formerly and after. <hi>Davids</hi> time better then <hi>Solomons</hi> for warre and noble victories. <hi>Solomons</hi> better for peace and plenty, and building and Merchandize. In the ſame times, one place may be growing better, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother groweth worſe: <hi>Epheſus</hi> may be decaying when <hi>Thyatyra</hi> encreaſeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 19 Some in every age are good, even now there be men <hi>antiquâ fide, priſcis moribus;</hi> And ſome in every age are nought.</p>

                  <hi>SOlomon</hi> in the former verſe, having judged it to ſpring from want of wiſdome, to conceive the former times to be alwayes better then the latter, and to enquire (as men ordinarily doe) of the reaſon thereof: He giveth in theſe and the following uſes, three ſeveral obſervations, touching the better and worſe eſtate of one age above another, as at any time, ſo for his own time. Firſt, For his own time, wherein wiſedome and wealth abounded; he telleth us not that it was better then other times, but that it was (ſo far forth) a good time; wiſdom ſaith he is good with an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and profitable for men, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And this he proveth, 1. From the benefit which either of them yeild apart: wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a defence, or rather a protection or refreſhing, and money is the like, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Secondly, From the more excellent benefit of wiſdom, but the excellency of wiſdom is, it giveth life to the owners of it, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Secondly, He calleth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the work of God in the eſtate of the times; as in his own age, ſo in every age: and the inſufficiency of any man to make ſtraight that which God hath made crooked, verſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61324:72"/>13. and therefore to make a good uſe of the viciſſitude of changes from age to age, verſe 14. Thirdly, He declareth that in the beſt times, at leaſt in his own time, he hath ſeen much evil, which he ſpecifyeth, verſe 15. to the end of the Chapter; and ſome good, verſe 19.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Wiſdome and wealth are then moſt profitable (or doe then moſt good) when they are enjoyed together, (or when they are met together.) It is then beſt for any perſon in whom they are ſo met, and beſt for any age, when the ſame age enjoyeth both. Thus much God implyeth in his bleſſing of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.10, to 13. For he preferreth <hi>Solomon</hi> above all former and preſent Kings in reſpect of the concurrences of both theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From the defect that is found in either wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or wealth alone. Of wiſdom alone, Firſt, It is not heard nor regarded, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.16. Secondly, It ſeldome get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up to ſuch places of authority, where it may put forth it ſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.7. He wants friends to ſpeake and make way for him. Of wealth alone, Firſt, it lyeth unprofitably by us, neither doing our ſelves or others that good it might, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. Secondly, It maketh men worſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. Proud, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. Covetous, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5. and Churliſh, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10, 11. Thirdly, It expoſeth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.25,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From ſome benefit in either of them alone. Wiſdome is a defence, the word is a <hi>ſhadow</hi> in the Text. Which is, Firſt, For defence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.8. Secondly, For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, <hi>Iſay</hi> 25.4, 5. Wealth is a defence and refreſhing, 1. Againſt hunger, thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, and injuries of Suits. 2. Procuring us many friends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14, 20. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other outward comforts, <hi>Eccleſ,</hi> 10, 19. Wiſdome is a defence and refreſhing, Firſt, As conveighing us under the wings of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24, 25. and ſo, 1. Giving life to us, and direction to our way; 2. Defending us from ſin, hell, wrath, <hi>Job.</hi> 28.28. and afflictions and evils, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.35. Secondly, Connſelling others for their good, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10.</p>

               <p>IN the former verſe <hi>Solomon</hi> delivered his third obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching the eſtate of the preſent times, to wit, what notable things he had obſerved in his own time. Firſt, that he hath obſerved in the dayes of his vanity, a juſt man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in his righteouſneſſe: and a wicked man holding out long in his wickedneſſe. A Second, ſee verſe 19. A Third, ſee verſe 20. A Fourth, ſee verſe 21.22. A Fifth, ſee verſe 23.24. A Sixth, ſee verſe 25.26. But from that firſt obſervation, <hi>Solomon</hi> inferreth a double Corollary, Firſt, Againſt exceſſive righteouſneſſe, which he diſſwadeth from; 1. By the diſeaſe accompanying it, which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much wiſdome: 2. By the danger following it: Why wilt thou deſtroy thy ſelfe? Secondly, Againſt continuance and growth in wickedneſſe, which he diwadeth from, Firſt, By the diſeaſe accompanying it, Folly, be not fooliſh: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By the danger following it, untimely Death, verſe 17. and urgeth the acceptance of both theſe Counſels by two motives, 1. By the goodneſſe of both. 2. By the help of God to eſchew both the contrary evils, verſe 18. <hi>Be not righteous
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61324:76"/>overmuch;</hi> Firſt, Some take this and the next verſe to be ſpoken by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the perſon of an Epicure or carnal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician: Seeing righteous men doe ſometime periſh in their righteouſneſſe, when wicked men prolong their dayes in wickedneſſe; It is a good courſe not to be overjuſt. And yet leaſt that ſhould ſeeme too groſſe and offenſive, It is a good courſe alſo not to be overwicked, but to keep a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both. But if <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeake in the perſon of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he would not ſecond it with his own approbation of the goodneſſe of both courſes, verſe 18. Beſides <hi>Solomon</hi> would not leave ſuch corrupt counſel without ſome aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of folly or vanity upon it, as he doth in the like caſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.5, 6. Verſe 5. ſheweth verſe 6. to be ſpoken in the perſon of the ſloathful man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others thinke by <hi>juſt overmuch,</hi> he meaneth rigorouſly juſt, who will remit no puniſhments, nor debts, nor rights, but exact Juſtice to extremity. And indeed had <hi>David</hi> puniſhed <hi>Joab</hi> for his murder of <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> he had deſtroyed himſelfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.39. But that overmuch righteouſneſſe is oppoſed to clemency or moderation; whereas this here is oppoſed to wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Others therefore underſtand the righteouſneſſe here ſpoken of to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis juſtitia,</hi> univerſal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, oppoſite to all wickedneſſe. But neither can that be the meaning of the word here. For, 1. No man can exceed in that righteouſneſſe, he cannot be overmuch righteous in that ſenſe, no, though he were as righteous as Angels, as Chriſt Jeſus, yea, infinitely righteous as God is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. to the excellent. 2. Neither can a man in Scripture phraſe be ſaid to periſh in that righteouſneſſe, though he ſhould dye for it. <hi>Stephen</hi> dying for his righteouſneſſe, or any other Martyre, is never ſaid to periſh in his righteouſneſſe, but to glorifie God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.18, 19, yea and to honour and preferre himſelfe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 17. But in Scripture phraſe a man is ſaid to periſh in his iniquity, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It remaineth therfore that by overmuch righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is meant, righteouſneſs over &amp; above the rule of the word; as by overmuch wiſdom (coupled herewith) is meant, wiſdom above that which is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. Of this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much righteouſneſs there be three ſorts: 1. That which is called Legal righteouſneſs; ſo called, not becauſe it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Law, but becauſe judiciaries take it ſo, as

               <p>To be wicked overmuch, implyeth two things: 1. Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin beyond the word. 2. Multiplication of it. Firſt, to make a mans ſelfe more wicked then the word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him: So exceſſively wicked, as thereupon to ſhut out a mans ſelfe from all hope of mercy, or otherwiſe worſe then he is. This exceſſe a man that is convinced of the emptineſſe of his righteouſneſſe which he prized overmuch before, is apt to ſink into, even to deſpaire. <hi>Cain,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought himſelf as righteous as his brother, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as acceptable as his, being convinced by God of his

But this ſenſe doth not fully anſwer the oppoſition in verſe 14. though it anſwer well enough to verſe 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly the phraſe may well be tranſlated, Do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil much, that is, Do not multiply tranſgreſſion, as <hi>Amos</hi> 4.4. The word is uſed in this ſenſe.

Secondly, Greater then will be forgiven, in regard either of our preſent hardneſſe of heart, which we deſpaire of ſoftning, or in regard of our perſon, which we judge to be reprobate. Thirdly, A ſin of an higher kinde then it is, as that to be a ſin of preſumption, when it is but a ſin of infirmity, though againſt light. Fourthly, our ſin, and ſpringing up in us, which is but caſt into us by Satan; as thoughts of blaſphemy darted into us, which our hearts tremble at and abhor.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61324:87"/>in <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation was wholly ſupernatural and given by free grace. But then <hi>Adam</hi> had been right without it, in which he was not, but right by it. It was indeed, Firſt, Supernatural, as not flowing from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of nature; a man is a perfect man without it for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Secondly, As not deſerved by men who had done neither good nor evil.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Natural, as due, Firſt, to the purity of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make us ſo perfect. Secondly, To the integrity of mans nature, without which he was not ſo perfect in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as were meet for Gods pure nature to make. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts herein extol the freeneſſe of grace to <hi>Adam,</hi> not to magnifie the grace of God, but to derogate from the grace of Chriſt. For if nature were entire and perfect without Gods Image, then the want of it in corrupt nature is no ſin but natural to man; And ſo original ſin depraving nature, and requiring neceſſity of a new birth in Chriſt, is no ſin, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to right nature; and ſo original ſin is no ſin, not only after baptiſme, but even before baptiſme. But concupiſcence is not of Gods worke in nature, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Concupiſcence and Rebellion of the lower parts of the ſoul againſt the higher is natural. For the man being made of a body and a ſoul, muſt needs be carried both to ſpiritual and ſenſual objects. And ſo this Rebellion and ſtirring of the one part againſt the other, will be found to ariſe from the principles of pure nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Refutation</hi> 1. From the power of wiſdom even in a mean man (as <hi>Adam</hi> is here meant, as alſo in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.2.) <hi>wiſdom maketh his face to ſhine.</hi> Secondly, from the change of the ſtrength or boldneſſe of his face, which may be referred, either to the former antecedent, and then it is meant, The the wiſe mans face, that is, <hi>Solomons</hi> face, the boldneſſe or ſtrength of it (as the word ſignifieth) ſhall be changed upon a wiſe and juſt admonition, or preſentment of his ſin before him (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6.)

               <p>That theſe words are thus to be taken by way of Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Anſwer, or Invention and Refutation, appeareth, firſt partly by the Coherence with the former Chapter: ſecondly partly from the unleaſonableneſs of the Preacher otherwiſe if he ſhould here extoll his own Tranſcendent wiſdom and ſoveraign power, when he is declaring and confeſſing his deepeſt penitential ſorrows, from <hi>v.</hi> 26 to the end of the foregoing Chapter.</p>

               <p>The Invention or excuſe was taken from the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and incontroulable Power and Authority of Princes, and the danger of oppoſing them (though but in word) in their way, <hi>v.</hi> 4.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61324:100"/>which he obſerved in the world, the promiſcuous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and events that befal good men and bad, chiefly by the miſ-government of Princes.</p>

And that he proveth; Firſt, By the equality of the goodneſſe hereof, the free and cheerful uſe of the good things of this life, being equal to any other courſe which a man can take in ſuch a caſe. Secondly, By the Permanency of this good with him as a ſauce to ſweeten all his labour in the dayes of his life which God giveth him, verſe 15. The coherence of theſe words with the former, is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw ſome wicked Rulers honourably buried, the puniſhment of ſome offenders prolonged, and thereby to outward view it might appeare that the eſtate of wicked men was better then the eſtate of the godly (ſave only that ſaith knoweth the contrary) verſe 10. to 13.

In theſe verſes by two Adjuncts, Firſt, By the reſtleſneſſe and aſſiduity of it, ſo as he found no reſt nor ſleep night nor day, to ſeek out this matter, verſe 16. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By the fruitleſneſſe of it, he could not finde what he ſought. Which he ſetteth forth by a double amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>à diverſis;</hi> 1. Of labour in ſearching, though a man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in ſeeking it out; 2. Of wiſdome, yea if a wiſe man thinke and purpoſe, and profeſſe to ſeek it, and to finde it out, and to know it, yet he ſhall not be able to attaine it, verſe 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A man that ſhall apply his heart to ſearch and diſcerne the wiſdome of God in his work and dealing with the righteous and with the wicked, though himſelfe be wiſe, and his labour great to finde it out, yet his labour ſhall be fruitleſſe, and himſelfe reſtleſſe. He ſpeaketh here of the wiſdome of God in his work and dealing with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and with the wicked (both alike) as appeareth by the verſe before, verſe 15. and the verſes following, Chap. 9. verſe 1.2, 3. His labour ſhall be fruitleſſe, for he ſhall not finde out what he ſought for <hi>verſe</hi> 17. and himſelfe reſtleſſe as <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth (and he ſeemeth to ſpeake it of himſelfe) there is that neither day nor night ſeeth ſleep with his eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Habac.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. <hi>Job</hi> 9.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſons</hi> why fruitleſſe: 1. From Gods concealment many times of the cauſes and reaſons of the afflictions of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially in the beginning of their troubles, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end. <hi>Job</hi> was long before he ſaw the reaſon of Gods ſtrange hand upon himſelfe, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2, to 7. And it is a great part of their affliction, that they cannot diſcerne the reaſon of Gods dealing with them. God concealeth his minde, till we have learned to preferre his wiſdome and will above our own, when <hi>Job</hi> ſtooped to this (<hi>Job</hi> 40.2, to 5. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.5, 6,) then he not onely ſaw a gracious Iſſue, but the cauſe of all his troubles, from Gods confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From the power of God to have brought to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61324:102"/>paſſe any ends of his own and ours in dealing bountifully with the godly, and juſtly with the wicked, if it had pleaſed him. Though ſanctified affliction be wholſome to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet God was able to have humbled and healed them without ſuch outward croſſes and afflictions. The ſpirit of grace could doe it effectually by the word. That God choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth rather to doe it by afflictions, what man can finde the reaſon? Or if ſome reaſon might be rendred in regard of our fellowſhip with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in ſin and vanity, and with the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in afflictions, yet why might not God have choſen rather to afflict the godly in the inner man, then in the outward man? and why might not the wicked have undergone greater afflictions in this world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3. From the free choyce which God maketh of ſome men (both of the good and of the bad) to deal well with ſome of both ſorts, and to deal ſharply with others of both ſorts, <hi>Job</hi> 21.23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſons.</hi> why reſtleſſe, 1. From the diſproportion between the faculty and the object. The wiſdome of God in theſe wayes of his providence is beyond our reach. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as when the members of the body are reached and ſtretched beyond their compaſſe, it chaſeth away all ſleep and reſt: ſo when the minde is ſet upon the rack by ſuch tranſcendent meditations, it rendeth the ſoul with vexation and reſtleſſe diſquietneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From the force of earneſt intention of the minde in difficult and abſtruſe ſtudies to waſte and ſcatter thoſe cool and moiſt vapours which riſe from the ſtomack to cool the braine, and would ſtop the paſſage of the animal ſpirits to the ſenſes, and ſo procure ſleep. For the animal ſpirits of the braine being heated with agitation and ſtudy, doe alſo heat thoſe vapours, and ſo attenuate and diſperſe, and ſpend them that they cannot ſtop the paſſage of the ſpirits to the ſenſes and ſo ſleep is chaſed away. This is a natural cauſe which is the more aggravated by the hand of God taking away natural reſt from ſuch as cannot reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his will, unleſſe they may be of his counſel, <hi>Job</hi> 33.13.</p>
               <p>

To teach us to content our ſelves in ſeeking out by our own wiſdom, the counſell of God in his dealing with our ſelves or others; but by faith and patience to wait for a good iſſue.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In two things; firſt, in placing of the heart; the heart of the wiſe is at his right hand; of the fool at his left, <hi>v.</hi> 2.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61324:114"/>Secondly, In the failing of a fooles heart in his ordinary courſe and way, and thereby bewraying himſelfe openly to be a fool, <hi>verſe</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. There is a great difference between a wiſe man and a fool, in the placing and carrying of their hearts. It is not to be thought there is any obſervable difference in the heart of a wiſe man and of a fool; for then ſome Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts would have obſerved it. But the heart is put Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically for the minde, judgement, and will of a man. And the Right and Left hand are put Metaphorically. The meaning is, Firſt, A wiſe man doth not ayme at ſiniſter ends in his work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.3. He aymeth ſincerely at the glory of God, and the good of himſelfe and others. A foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Phariſee (Chriſt calleth them ſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.17, 19.] he doth all to be ſeen of men, <hi>Matsh.</hi> 6.2, 5, 16. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. or for ſome ſelfiſh end or other. Secondly, A wiſe man carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his thoughts and workes with ſtrength and dexterity. As the Right hand is counted the ſtronger then the Left: ſo what is wrought with ſtrength is attributed to the Right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.15, 16, &amp; 98, 1. Thirdly, A wiſe man may be ſaid to have his heart at his Right hand, in that he taketh all things in the faireſt and beſt ſenſe from God or man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.19. On the contrary a fool makes a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter conſtruction of that which is well meant from God or man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.2, 3, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5: Fourthly, The Right hand is a place of preheminence and bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.14, 17, 18, 19. In which reſpect a wiſe man taketh wayes of preferment to higheſt honour before the moſt high, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24, &amp; 10, 20, 21, &amp; 12, 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.33. And for carrying on their hearts in their courſe of life, there is great difference, between the wiſe and the fool. The fool in his ordinary and daily courſe of life, (which in <hi>verſe</hi> 3. is called his way) his heart faileth him, and faileth him ſo farre that he expreſſeth and diſcovereth his folly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to all that obſerve him. Not that <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a natural fool, that as he walketh in the Streets, diſcovereth to all that he is a fool by his looks and geſture: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeldome or never ſpeaketh of them in all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: but he ſpeaketh of a carnal wicked man, deſtitute both of ſpiritual wiſdome, and wiſdome fit for his calling: And the words may according to the Text be tranſlated, <q rend="margQuotes">yea alſo as he that is a fool walketh in his way, his heart
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61324:114"/>faileth him, and he ſaith to all men he is a fool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24, 25,</q>

God is the ſtrength of the godly wiſe mans heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. But in an hypocrite (much more in an open wicked man,) his heart is empty at his beſt: and being empty, Satan will ſoon repoſſeſſe him, and hurry him to open offences and miſcarriages, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44, 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From the failing of the heart the way will be openly vaine, and fooliſh, and wicked. <hi>Text.</hi>

               <p>BUt wiſdome is profitable [or excellent] to direct, If the Serpent doe bite without enchantment, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Maſter of the tongue. In the former verſe <hi>Solomon</hi> had obſerved ſundry vanities (as it were indeed flyes) found

                  <hi>A child]</hi> not ſo much in yeers; For <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe was very young when he came to the Crown; <hi>David</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>he was young and tender,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Joaſh</hi> was but ſeven yeers old, when he began to raign, yet he ruled well all the daies of his youth, from the good councel of his uncle <hi>Jehojada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was but ſixteen yeers old, yet he raigned well in his young time, by the good counſel of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.3, 4, 5. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was but eight yeers old, and he ſurpaſſed them all, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.1. Onely <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> of all the young Kings, beginning to raign at twelve yeers, he did evil in his youth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.1.</p>
               <p>A child therefore is rather meant childiſh, 1. In under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 14.20. 2 In affection and diſpoſition: Firſt, cleaving to young Counſellors, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.8. Secondly, ſoon wavering in Religion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. Thirdly, led by ſenſe and ſenſible objects, more then by depth of judgement and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; led by paſſions and luſts of youth, paſtimes and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but careleſſe of matters of importance. Thus <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> is ſaid to be young and tender in heart, when he was above forty one yeers old, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.21. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.7. And ſo indeed <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth this childiſhneſſe in ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and remiſneſſe of government, <hi>v.</hi> 18. as by eating in the morning, he expreſſeth luxurious feaſting, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>

And the exceſſe and riot of their eating, to wit, for gluttouy and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, rather then for ſtrength, as appeareth by the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Princes diet, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From the danger of childiſh government to a State, as alſo of riotous government. Which dangers be 1. Remiſneſſe of government or ſlothfulneſſe, whence the decay of all good in a Commonwealth, as in a houſe is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; as decay of juſtice, trading, military power, and skill, honour and reputation with forraign Princes and States; and which is worſt of all, decay in Religion, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61324:120"/>purity thereof; whence alſo dropping in of contentious corruptions into all ſorts. 2. Prodigall expence of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the State in feaſting and banquetting, in Masks and Revels, where money muſt anſwer all; and that not a purſe full, or pocket full, or bag full, or cheſt full, but a whole Kings Treaſury; and when that faileth, then illegall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſubjects eſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſonne of Nobles]</hi> not ſo much of Noble anceſtors, for moſt Kings are ſuch, and yet their Kingdoms not alwaies bleſſed. Yea ſometimes they that are raiſed from low eſtates, (as <hi>David</hi> from following the ſheep) may be bleſſed Princes, and the Land bleſſed in them. But a <hi>ſonne of Nobles,</hi> is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſon, a man of a noble ſpirit, or Heroës, (for from the Hebrew word <hi>Heroë</hi> it ſeems to be derived) are ſo called of whiteneſſe, not ſo much for wearing white Garments, as being bright and glorious, <hi>Viro Illuſtres, &amp; clariſſimi,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Dark or obſcure men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29.</p>
               <p>A man of a Noble ſpirit, Firſt, <hi>Notabilis,</hi> wel known and approved for his vertues, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13. Secondly, Of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpirit, regardeth publike good ends, more then private ſelf-ends, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 137.6. Thirdly, Affecteth rather to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then feared, and yet to be feared to with due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Servile natures are imperious and cruel: <hi>[aut ſervit humiliter, aut ſuperbè dominatur]</hi> Noble ſpirits (as of Lyons) wil <hi>parcere ſubjectis,</hi> be moderate in puniſhments, mercifull in ſuppliants. Fourthly, regardeth honour above life, much more before money, preferring the fifth Commandement above the ſixth, much more above the eighth.</p>
               <p>Eate in due ſeaſon, 1. For time, not in the morning. 2. For meaſure, not for exceſſe in gluttony and drunkenneſſe, but ſparingly.</p>
               <p>But for ſtrength, 1. Of body and mind. 2. Of fitneſſe to the duties of their place.</p>

                  <hi>Parts two:</hi> Firſt, a commandement, forbidding to curſe the King; or rich and great men, his Princes and Officers.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61324:123"/>give <hi>the</hi> bread; <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.8. Pay debts firſt, give after. Fourthly, To doe it freely without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence from them on whom you caſt your bread. Bread caſt <hi>on water</hi> will either ſink or ſwim away, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13, 14. By waters is not here meant <hi>locus irriguus,</hi> moiſt and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ground, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 32, 20. for there it is not ſaid <hi>beſides all waters</hi> (where ſuch places are fruitfull:) but <hi>upon the face</hi> of the waters. Nor here meant watery faces, weeping for want, though that be part of the meaning, Fifthly, To doe it ſincerely, without aym of vainglory. This bread thus caſt upon the face of the waters, ſtayeth not to be ſeen of men, but either ſinketh or ſwimmeth away. Bread given as the Phariſees did for vainglory, is caſt rather upon pillars of Marble, or of Braſſe, rather then upon fleeting waters. Sixthly, to doe it frequently and often, not rarely, and to a few; give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven put for many, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Micah</hi> 5.5. A good man <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeth</hi> his beneficence, to wit, to many, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.9. The larger the field is, wherein ſeed is ſcattered the more hope of a plentifull harveſt. Seventhly, to doe it wiſely and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly; <hi>Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight,</hi> implieth, 1. Not all to others, leaving none for home; but give <hi>a part.</hi> 2. Not all to ſome, none to others, but a <hi>part to ſeven, and alſo to eight.</hi> 3. Not a Pittance, but a <hi>portion;</hi> ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as whereon a poor man may work, and occupy, to doe ſome good withall, as with a portion.</p>

                  <hi>SOlomon</hi> in regard of the dangers of the-times, when Kings are childiſh, and Princes humerous, exhorted to libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. which was the ſecond duty he inferred upon that occaſion. In theſe words he preſſeth ſtill the ſame, but with an enlargement unto all faithfulneſſe and diligence in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61324:124"/>any duty of a mans calling, eſpecially in ſuch dangerous times; which is a third improvement of ſuch evil times. To ſet forward this duty, he removeth a doubt which might hinder a man from Benificence and fruitfulneſſe in his courſe and calling. The doubt is taken either from the ſear of ſome danger, or danger that might befall a man in ſo doing, which he expreſſeth under a proverbial compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, taken from husbandmen, who for feare of foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe ſometimes neglect ſome duty of husbandry in ſeed time or harveſt, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Or elſe, from ſome difficulty, which ſometimes accompany Chriſtian and holy, and great undertakings of duty, eſpecially ſuch duties as may help forward Reformation in ſuch times.</p>
               <p>To the former he anſwereth, <hi>v.</hi> 4. That ſuch feares of damage and danger are more dangerous then the hurt we feare: For they will prevent the performance of all good duties, and the recompence of that performance: As an husbandman that obſerveth the wind ſhall never ſow, and he that obſerveth the clouds ſhall never reap, <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To the latter he anſwereth, by oppoſing the ſtrange and ſecret aſſiſtance, and ſucceſſe, and deliverance which God giveth unto men in the duties of their calling. Which he amplifieth by a compariſon from the like ſecret aſſiſtance and deliverance which God giveth to the child faſhioned in the wombe, both in the framing of his ſpirit (or ſoule) and in the ſetting and ordering of his bones; which is a ſtrange, yet ordinary ſecret in nature, like unto which all the works which a man undertaketh in his calling are faſhioned and wrought of God, who worketh all, <hi>v.</hi> 5. And thus it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, when God is pleaſed to put to his helping hand to us in the works of our calling; otherwiſe nothing proſpereth in our hand.</p>
               <p>From both which <hi>Solomon</hi> inferreth an exhortation to diligence, and fruitfulneſs in our calling, directly contrary to the former doubts and difficulties. The Objector pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded doubts and difficulties, and thereupon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſow. But <hi>Solomon</hi> inferreth a contrary concluſion; therefore to ſow more abundantly and diligently. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening let not thy hand reſt,</hi> or ceaſe.

               <p>IN theſe words <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorteth to fruitfulneſſe in good duties, the duties of our calling eſpecially thoſe that are moſt behooveful in ill times: by removing the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are three: Firſt, From the hazzard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (yet uncertaine danger) that may befal our ſelves, of which was ſpoken in <hi>verſe</hi> 4.

As is the way of the ſpirit, and of the bones of the woman with childe, ſo is the way of God in working our workes for us, ſecret and hidden from us; yet, when he pleaſeth carry them on effectually. <hi>The way of the ſpirit</hi>] is the way of enterance of it into the infant conceived in the wombe. To beget a ſoul, is beyond the skill or ſtrength of the Parents, yea, or to frame the body in the wombe; yea, we know not how God worketh it: Whether, Firſt, By Creation of nothing? If ſo, whether God maketh it pure? then how commeth it to be defiled? the body being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin (as a carcaſſe after death) cannot defile the ſoul with ſin. If impure? then how is not God the Author of ſin. Secondly, By Propagation: If ſo, then it is made either of the whole ſoul of the Parents: and then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would dye; or of part of the ſoul, and then the ſoul were partible or diviſible; and the ſoul of the Parents would be maimed; or of the ſeed of the ſoul: but it hath no excrement, as having no ſuperfluity of nouriſhment. Thirdly, By transfuſion; as one candle transfuſeth the like candle light into prepared matter: If ſo, then why doe not acts of generation often ſpeed in couples moſt ſuitable? and why are the ſouls of children ſo often unlike to Parents?</p>

               <p>Fourthly, By efformation, as the Potter formeth a veſſel out of Clay; which of all the reſt is moſt probable, to wit, that God formeth the ſoul though not of nothing (which is properly Creation) but of pre-exiſtent matter, whether of the ſpirituous part of the ſeed (which is eaſie for God to doe) or of the ſouls of the Parents, as of <hi>Adams</hi> rib he made his wifes body, which no man can doe but only God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then God hath given to nature to produce ſuch a worke.

               <p>
                  <hi>Or the way of the ſpirit</hi>] may be meant, the manner of its faſhioning the Organs of the body, in caſe it be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to God, in being (as they ſay it is) <hi>Sui domicilij architectrix,</hi> how commeth the ſoul to worke ſo skilful and curious a Fabrick which it knoweth not, nor can ſhape the like when it is growne up to ripeſt underſtanding, skill, and experience.

               <p>Firſt, the darkneſſe of the lights about them, whether naturall as Sunne, light (of the day when the Sunne is under a cloud) Moon, Stars: or artificiall lights, as Candles, Torches, &amp;c. This darkneſs commeth not from the decay of thoſe lights, but from the dimneſs of our ſight, whence need of ſpectacles. I doe not underſtand this to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of adverſity; for though darkneſſe be often put for adverſity, and light for proſperity, yet we read not of the Sunne, Moon and Stars put together for proſperity; nor the darkneſſe of them put for adverſity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The returning of the clouds after rain</hi>] is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the winterly ſtate of old age. In Summer after rain the clouds break up, and fair weather followeth; but in winter ſeaſon after rain clouds ſtill remain, and return. So, though in youth, after weeping and coughs, and rheumes dried up, the braine is clearer and drier: yet in old age, after colds, and coughs, and rheumes, and Pozes, there ſtill remain and return clouds, and vapors, and ſumes in the brain, through the ſtore of ſuperfluous and excrementitious moiſture of old bodies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When the keepers of the houſe tremble] verſ.</hi> 3. Some take thoſe keepers of the houſe to be the five ſenſes, which are indeed the keepers of the body; but their decay is not fitly called trembling. And beſides, of their decay he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth expreſly in the ſequel. <hi>The keepers of the houſe</hi>] are therfore the hands and arms which in young men are ſteady and ſtrong, and doe alſo keep both the body and houſe by repulſing annoyances, and providing uſefull things, food, rayment, &amp;c. Theſe tremble, grow feeble, and ſhake in old age.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The ſtrong men bow themſelves</hi>] when the thighs and legs, which in young men went ſtreight and ſtrong, now buckle, and ſtoop, that an old man ſtandeth in need of a ſtaffe to ſupport him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The grinders ceaſe, becauſe they are few]</hi> when the teeth ceaſe to chew meat, many of them being worn out. Teeth come not with us into the world, and they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave old men (at leaſt many of them) before they leave the world.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:61324:133"/>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Thoſe that look out at the windows are darkned]</hi> when the eyes grow ſo dim that we cannot ſee well with ſpectacles, which is a further degree of dimneſſe of ſight then was mentioned in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The doors are ſhut without, when</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>the ſound of the grinding is low] verſ.</hi> 4. that is, the lips (which are the doores, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 141.3.) are ſhut together, when for want of teeth to grind the meat, the meat is rolled and chavelled in the mouth, and had need of ſhut lips to keep it from falling out of the mouth:</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>He ſhall riſe up at the ſound of the hird]</hi> the leaſt noiſe of a Swallow or other bird, will waken an old man, through the naturall drineſſe of his brain, and through the wearineſſe of any poſture; in the day time he is weary of ſitting, and ſoon goeth to bed with the Lamb; in the night he is weary of lying, and ſoon riſeth with the Lark.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>The daughters of muſick are abaſed]</hi> when either Inſtruments of ſpeech faile which make muſick, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hearing faile which receive muſick. Speech and hearing both faile, as in <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.35. Which is the more obſervable, that old men whoſe hearing is ſo quick as to be wakened with the ſound of a bird, and yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſiteneſs of the ſenſe of hearing (to delight in the ſound of muſick) is quite gone.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>They ſhall be afraid of that which is high, and feare ſhall be in the way] verſe</hi> 5. becauſe old men are afraid of climbing in regard of the ſtiffeneſſe of their joynts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildineſſe of their bodies. They feare any ſtumbling ſtone in the way, leaſt it give them a fall, or any thing that mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, leaſt it throw them downe.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, <hi>The Almond Tree flouriſheth</hi>] When his head groweth gray and hoary, which is a floutiſhing Ornament, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. but an evident decay of due moyſture to nouriſh the haire of the head and Beard. The Almond Tree is the firſt that flouriſheth in the ſpring, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.11, 12. and hath his name from early bloſſoming; it is here a reſemblance of an hoary head, yet with this difference, 1. The Almond Tree flouriſheth in the Spring, the hoary head in the winter of our Age. 2. The Tree flouriſheth before fruit, but the head flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth after it: And yet it may indeed be ſaid, that the hoary head is the flouriſhing of the old man in the ſpring of another world of Immortality.</p>

Though the locuſt be a cleane and wholſome food, and much uſed in thoſe Countreyes (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the poorer ſort) <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4. yet it is heavy and burdenſome to an old mans ſtomack,</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>Deſire faileth</hi>] Or appetite; either to meat or drinke, or eſpecially to marriage fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>The latter ſort of particular infirmities accompanying old Age, are ſuch decayes of nature in old men, as are found in their decrepit Age, when they are drawing on to death, and mourners goe about the Streets; for they are not called till death, or till enterance into the gates of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When man goeth to his long home</hi>] That is, to the houſe of his age, the grave where he ſhall reſt whilſt the world ſtandeth, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The mourners goe about the Streets</hi>] To wit, the women skilful in mourning for the dead, and that with ſuch affection and geſture, and lamentation, as to ſtirre up mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a whole company, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Or ever the ſilver cord be looſed</hi>] That is, the marrow of the backe bone, which runneth from the Braine through the necke, to the bottome of the back through 24 joynts, and takes in therewith all the ſinewes: whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a ſhaking and trembling of all the joynts, and utter feebleneſs to uſe any limbe without helpe, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Or rather the ſinewes well, are the ligaments of all the members, and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by cold humours and Palſey diſtempers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Golden Boul is broken</hi>] When the Scull is parted in the ſutures or ſeames of it, whence the Chaps fall, the Almonds of the eares are ſtopped, part lifting up againe. For the Hebrew is the ſame with <hi>Golgotha</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Scull, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.35. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.33. It is a Bowle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is round, and golden both for the colour, and for the pretious uſe of it to containe and preſerve the Braine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Pitcher broken at the Spring</hi>] That is, the bladder is broken at the ſpring of water, the Iſſuing forth of the water or the retentive faculty of the muſcle at the neck of the bladder being broken, ſo that water <hi>(urine)</hi> iſſueth from him inſenſibly, without ſtay.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:61324:135"/>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The wheele broken at the Ciſterne</hi>] Is the Lungs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from their motion of inſpiration and reſpiration by phlegme from the ſtomacke, which is as the Ciſterne from all the body. The Lungs are as a wheele tranſmitting the Aire in and out, up and downe: But though there be no open paſſage between the Stomacke and the Lungs (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no ordinary purging of the Lungs but upwards by ſpitting and coughing) yet when the Stomacke is ſurcharged with phlegme, it diſtilleth it into the Lungs and ſtoppeth them; look as when a man or beaſt is dead, there ſeemeth no way of enterance into the bladder for water, no not for Aire (for if you blow it full of winde, none will iſſue out:) And yet whileſt there is life in the body, both water and ſand paſſe through little veines into the bladder. So by the like ſecret paſſages doth the Ciſterne of the Stomacke convey phlegme to the Lungs, even to the ſtifling of them. And upon this ſtoppage of the Lungs with phlegme, that the wheele cannot turne the Aire (or breath) up and downe, in and out, followeth rutling in the Throat, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the motion of the Lungs, and ſo death ſuddenly followeth.</p>

               <p>FRom this verſe to the end of the chapter is the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which conſiſteth of two parts: Firſt, an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the reading of this and other books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from <hi>verſe</hi> 9, to 12. Secondly, the ſum or ſcupe, and uſe of this and the other books of Scripture, to fear God, and keep his commandements; ſet forth and confirmed by a twofold Reaſon: firſt, from the compleat duty of man. Secondly, from the exact judgement of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. The former of theſe, to wit, the encouragement to the reading of this and other books of Scripture, is ſet on by ſeven Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: Firſt, from <hi>Solomon</hi> improvement of his wiſdom to teach the people knowledge; and that proportionably, according to his wiſdom. The more wiſe the Preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the elaborate diligence in pondering or weighing, ſeeking out, ordering fit matters or words.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the matter &amp; frame of his words; they were words 1. Of knowledge. 2. Of weight or power; the word ſignifieth to rule or have authority, as if the words were fit to command ſaith and obedience, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. 3. Acceptable words, words of delight, <hi>v.</hi> 10. 4. Upright. 5. Of truth, v. 10.</p>
